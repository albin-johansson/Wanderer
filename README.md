Wanderer is an 2D indie game, being developed for fun. At the time of writing, the game is still in an experimental state and isn't ready to be played.

## Compatibility

Wanderer is developed using MSVC, intended to run on Windows machines. As a result, the codebase occasionally takes
advantage of minor non-standard improvements of the STL found in the MSVC STL implementation, such as better `noexcept` coverage. Other than that, the code should be platform independent.

## Dependencies

- [Centurion](https://github.com/albin-johansson/Centurion) A multi-media library built on top of SDL2.
- [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) An amazing ECS library. One of the best libraries I've ever used!
- [step](https://github.com/albin-johansson/step) A parsing library for the Tiled JSON format. Was originally a part of the Wanderer codebase.
- [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) Very well-written JSON library, despite being limited to C++11.
