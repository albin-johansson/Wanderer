An exploration based 2D game that is currently in development. 

## Installation
Wanderer is developed and compiled for Windows, so if you want to run the game on another OS, you'll
need to compile the code by yourself. However, the code should be OS-independent through the use of
 SDL2.
 
- Install the [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)
 runtime environment.
- Add the MinGW and MinGW/bin folders to your system PATH environment variable.

As long you're using Windows and have the MinGW environment installed correctly, you should be
 able to simply run the executable.

## Tools & Frameworks Used
* C++17
* SDL2 
    - SDL2_image
    - SDL2_mixer
    - SDL2_ttf
* Catch2
* MinGW
* Windows 10
* CLion
* CMake

## Dependencies
These are the dependencies required for developing the Wanderer game. This section can be ignored
 if you're not interested in the frameworks used.

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - A library written in C that provides many useful abstractions for cross-platform
 development.
  - [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) - Extension for SDL2 that provides
   better support for hardware-accelerated textures from common file types such as PNG.
  - [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) - Extension for SDL2 that provides
   support for TrueType fonts (.ttf).
  - [SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) - Another extension for SDL2 that
   enables multi-channel audio playback.
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) - A powerful testing framework, which is distributed as a single header file.
