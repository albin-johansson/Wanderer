Wanderer is an 2D indie game, being developed for fun. At the time of writing, the game is still in an experimental state and isn't ready to be played.

## Compatibility

Wanderer is developed using MSVC, intended to run on Windows machines. As a result, the codebase occasionally takes
advantage of minor non-standard improvements of the STL found in the MSVC STL implementation, such as better `noexcept` coverage. Other than that, the code should be platform independent.
